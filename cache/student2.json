It might provide a structure that suits Mary's needs better. \n* **Special Education:** Depending on her challenges, she may qualify for special education services which could offer individualized support. This should be discussed with the school guidance counselor. \n\n**Accommodations:**\n\n* **Math Support:**\n    * **Re-teach:**  Provide an opportunity to re-learn basic math concepts through interactive learning tools like manipulatives or visual aids. \n    * **Differentiated Instruction:** Adjust the curriculum and lesson plans based on Mary's strengths and weaknesses. Incorporate hands-on activities, real-world examples, and alternative assessments for her to explore at her pace.\n    * **Math Clubs & Peer Tutoring:**  Allow her to benefit from peer support and mentorship in a more relaxed setting where she can actively engage with classmates who are also struggling or succeed. \n\n**Counseling Services:**\n* **Individual Counseling:** Encourage Mary to seek individual counseling to address underlying issues that might contribute to her difficulties. This could include exploring coping mechanisms for stress, challenging situations, or academic struggles.\n\n\n **Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Open Dialogue:**  Establish open communication with Mary's family and school counselor to ensure all parties are on the same page.\n* **Confidentiality and Respect:** It is crucial that she feels safe and respected throughout this process. Discuss everything openly and honestly to build trust and help Mary feel understood. \n* **Professional Guidance:** Collaborate with school counselors, teachers, social workers, or other professionals who can provide support and guidance.\n\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Focus on her strengths:**  Highlight Mary's academic accomplishments.

Given this context, an appropriate response requires a multifacedi al approach considering Mary's immediate need for support as well as her long-term educational goals. Here are some recommended placement options and accommodations that could benefit Mary:\n\n1. **Intensive Remedial Education** - This would be beneficial if academic struggles, specifically in math where she has a D grade, seem to pose significant barriers for her progressing through school curriculum standards successfully. Tutor-supported classes or small group instruction with an emphasis on mastery learning may help Mary improve her understanding of mathematical concepts and increase her confidence in this subject area. \n\n2. **Inclusion Education Model** - Rather than removing Mary from the classroom entirely, she could be placed within a regular educational setting wherein appropriate accommodations are made to support her academic growth while maintaining social connections with peers who can provide positive role models and opportunities for collaborative learning experiences outside of academics. This would help reinforce that school is not solely about grades but also about personal development, belongingness and the building of lifelong skills in a community setting. \n\n3. **Educational Intervention Program** - For students facing academic challenges due to their social or emotional needs like Mary might be experiencing as well, educational interventions that address both her academics and underlying personal issues could provide comprehensive support for her recovery journey in the long term while still allowing her continued education. These programs typically combine intensive tutoring with individual counseling services to help students improve their academic performance by simultaneously working on areas of social-emotional difficulties, substance abuse problems or mental health conditions that may be contributing factors for drug use and poor school attendance.\n\nSome additional accommodations might include: \n* A flexible schedule with reduced course load allowing Mary to catch up academically while attending counseling services on a regular basis;  \n* Frequent meetings between the teacher, guidance counselor or educational intervention specialist and parents/caregivers for collaborative problem-solving strategies around school attendance as well as personal support outside of classroom hours to help Mary manage her drug use issues while maintaining academic progress. \n* Extra time on assignments with the understanding that late work would not affect grades, which can reduce anxiety and pressure for students who struggle academically;  \n* Accessibility accommodations like extra-time during tests or examinations if Mary finds it difficult to concentrate due to her history of drug use (though this should be a temporary measure until she has shown improvement in self-management skills); \n* A peer tutoring program where other students can help mentor and support Mary's learning process, creating an inclusive community;  \n* Training for staff on how best to communicate with youth like Mary who may have had negative experiences within the education system that has led them to seek drugs as a coping mechanism. \n\nOverall, it is vital for school administrators and educators not only address immediate academic needs but also understand underlying issues affecting students' educational success such as substance abuse problems. Effective interventions must provide holistic support that meets the individual student in an empathetic manner while creating a safe learning environment conducive to their long-term personal growth and recovery journey alongside education attainment goals.",
