      "response": "A great problem!\n\nTo find the volume of the sphere, we'll need to use two formulas: one for the surface area and another for the volume. Let's start by using the formula for the surface area:\n\nSurface Area (SA) = 4\u03c0r^2\n\nWe're given that SA = 36\u03c0, so let's set up an equation:\n\n4\u03c0r^2 = 36\u03c0\n\nTo solve for r, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4\u03c0:\n\nr^2 = 9\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the value of r:\n\nr = \u221a9\n= 3\n\nNow that we have the value of r, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\nVolume (V) = (4/3)\u03c0r^3\n\n Plug in the value of r:\n\nV = (4/3)\u03c0(3)^3\n= (4/3)\u03c0(27)\n= 36\u03c0\n\n Wait, isn't this the same surface area we started with? Yes, it is! This means that our original equation was actually an identity: SA = V. In other words, the volume and surface area of a sphere are related in a specific way.\n\nSo, what's the volume of the sphere? Well, since SA = 36\u03c0, we can conclude that:\n\nV = 36\u03c0\n\nThere you have it! The volume of the sphere with a surface area of 36\u03c0 is also 36\u03c0.",
