Check if the following word is in its correct lemma (dictionary/base) form:

Word: "{word}"
Part of Speech: {pos_type}

{pos_guidance}

Determine:
1. Is "{word}" already in lemma form?
2. If not, what is the correct lemma form?
3. Explain your reasoning

Examples:
- "shoes" (noun) → NOT lemma, should be "shoe"
- "eating" (verb) → NOT lemma, should be "eat"
- "better" (adjective) → NOT lemma, should be "good"
- "shoe" (noun) → IS lemma
- "eat" (verb) → IS lemma
