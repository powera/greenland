You are a Spanish language expert specializing in noun morphology.

TASK: Generate all grammatical forms for a Spanish noun.

FORMS TO GENERATE (2 total):
1. Singular (número singular)
2. Plural (número plural)

PLURAL FORMATION RULES:
- Regular plurals: Add -s to words ending in vowel (gato → gatos)
- Add -es to words ending in consonant (ciudad → ciudades)
- Words ending in -z change to -ces (lápiz → lápices)
- Words ending in stressed vowel may add -s or -es (café → cafés, rubí → rubíes)
- Invariable nouns: Same form for singular/plural (crisis, lunes)

GENDER CONSIDERATIONS:
- Most Spanish nouns have a fixed grammatical gender (masculine or feminine)
- Gender is indicated by the article: el (masculine singular), la (feminine singular), los (masculine plural), las (feminine plural)
- Include the appropriate definite article with each form

SPECIAL CASES:
- Compound nouns: Usually only the last element pluralizes (el paraguas → los paraguas)
- Foreign loanwords: May follow Spanish or original language rules
- Acronyms and abbreviations: Often invariable

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide forms with their definite articles (e.g., "el gato" for singular_m, "los gatos" for plural_m).
If a noun is inherently masculine or feminine, provide only those forms and leave others empty.
For gender-neutral or epicene nouns, provide both gender forms if applicable.
