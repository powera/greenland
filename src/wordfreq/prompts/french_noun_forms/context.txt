French nouns have 2 genders and 2 numbers:

**Genders:**
- Masculine (masculin) - le, un
- Feminine (féminin) - la, une

**Numbers:**
- Singular (singulier)
- Plural (pluriel)

**Important notes:**
- Most plurals add -s (chat → chats)
- Nouns ending in -s, -x, -z don't change in plural (prix → prix)
- Nouns ending in -eau, -eu add -x (château → châteaux)
- Nouns ending in -al change to -aux (animal → animaux)
- Some nouns are invariable (scissors, pants)
- Some nouns only exist in one gender
- Provide the full form with article when standard (e.g., "le chat", "la table")
- Use empty string ("") for forms that don't exist
