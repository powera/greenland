SPECIAL NOTE ON FAMILY RELATIONS:
Family relation terms vary significantly across languages. Some languages distinguish:
- Older vs. younger siblings (e.g., Korean: 형 hyeong/오빠 oppa for older brother)
- Male vs. female cousins
- Paternal vs. maternal relatives (e.g., uncle from father's side vs. mother's side)
- Age-relative terms (e.g., Chinese: 哥哥 gēge older brother vs. 弟弟 dìdi younger brother)

When encountering family relation terms, always classify them as "family_relation" regardless of these
language-specific distinctions. The database supports creating multiple overlapping lemmas for the same
English concept (e.g., separate lemmas for "older brother" and "younger brother") that can be enabled
for specific target languages where such distinctions are important.
