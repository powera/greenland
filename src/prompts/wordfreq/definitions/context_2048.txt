The base form (lemma) for each definition

Example sentences for each definition
- These should use the exact word provided, not a differently-formatted form.
- Provide up to three example sentences for each definition.

For lemmatization (finding the base form):
- For nouns: the singular form (e.g., "cats" → "cat")
- For verbs: the infinitive form without "to" (e.g., "running" → "run")
- For adjectives and adverbs: the positive form (e.g., "better" → "good")

For Chinese translations:
- Provide a translation that specifically matches the given definition, not other meanings of the word
- Unless a one-character term is unambiguous, provide a two-character term (e.g., prefer '跳舞' over '舞')
- Do not print the pinyin, just the characters.
- When multiple translations are possible, choose the most common or appropriate one
- Only provide translations into standard Mandarin Chinese (not regional variants)

For phonetic spellings:
- Provide the pronuncation for the specific definition of the word.
- Use simplified phonetic pronunciation using capital letters for stressed syllables
- Hyphenate between syllables
- Use familiar English spelling patterns (e.g., "SOO-duh-nim" for "pseudonym", "MUH-ther" for "mother", "TRANS-port" for "transport", "duh-BREE" for "debris")
- This should only use standard English letters

For IPA:
- Provide the pronuncation for the specific definition of the word.
- Use American English pronunciations for words.

In summary: for each definition, provide in order:
1. The definition text
2. The part of speech
3. The part-of-speech subtype
4. The phonetic spelling
5. The lemma (base form)
6. The IPA pronuncation of the word
7. Whether this is a special case (foreign word, part of name, etc.)
8. At least one example sentence
9. Any additional notes about the definition
10. The Chinese translation
11. A confidence score (0-1) - the most common definition should have confidence of 1, less-common or domain specific definitions should have confidence around 0.9.

Remember to separate different definitions (e.g., "bank" as a financial institution vs. "bank" as the side of a river).
