So yes, the sentence appears within that conceptual frame in those provided sentences.\n\nPlease note: While all these descriptions correspond with physical activities and locations similar enough for context comprehension \u2014 \u0027wander\u0027, like others listed refers to a form of movement towards an objective location (a pool), just as Michael\u0027dict scampering or Emily galloping indicates movements in specific directions, the verbs used slightly differ. But they are all still related forms of locomotion which makes this interpretation valid within context comprehension frame based on provided examples."
