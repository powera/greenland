Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) \u2013 An aspen clone can cover large areas of land with its yellow-green leaves that shimmer in the breeze, prevalent across North Dakota and Wyoming's Great Plains to northern Minnesota.  \n3. Red Oak (Quercus rubra) - Recognizable for their lobed red or dark brown acorns which turn brilliant colors during autumn seasons; they can be seen in Ohio\u2019s deciduous woodlands, extending down into the Appalachian region of West Virginia and Kentucky to Illinois' Mississippi River valley.  \n4. White Oak (Quercus alba) - Known for its impressive size and longevity alongside stunning white or gray bark that often peels in strips; found extensively throughout Pennsylvania, New York\u2019s Adirondacks, and upstate Maine's deciduous forests.\n5. Tulip Tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) - Also known as the Tuliptree or Yellow Poplar due to its yellow flowers that resemble a lily-of-the-valley; common throughout Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota's deciduous forests.\n6. White Pine (Pinus strobus)- This tall conifer is often planted near deciduous trees in city parks across the Midwest because of its striking needles that stay green year round providing a beautiful contrast during fall season; it can be found from southern Minnesota to Michigan and westward into North Dakota.\n7. American Beech (Fagus grandifolia) - Recognizable for their smooth gray bark, shiny dark leaves with wavy edges which turn brownish-yellow in autumn before dropping off allowing the bright white inner bark of older trees to show; found from southern Michigan down into Ohio and West Virginia.\n8. Tulip Tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) - This large tree, known for its distinctive trumpet shaped flowers that bloom in early spring followed by the foliage turning golden yellow before it falls off; found from southern New York westward into Ohio and Indiana\u2019s deciduous hardwood hammocks.\n9. Black Walnut (Juglans nigra)- While not as common, these trees can still be seen in select regions of Missouri down through Kentucky to Michigan's Great Lakes region; their deep purple-black fruits with a distinctive nut inside are loved by wildlife but considered invasive elsewhere.\n10. Redbud (Cercis canadensis)- Recognizable for its bright red or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, before the leaves appear and they usually retain these colorful flower bracts throughout summer; found from southern New York down into Tennessee, Kentucky\u2019s deciduous bottomlands to Illinois' prairies.\n11. Yellow Buckeye (Aesculus glabra)- Recognizable by their clusters of small white flowers followed by the growth of large brown seed pods filled with buckeye nuts; found from southern Ohio and Indiana down into northern Tennessee, Kentucky\u2019s deciduous forests to Illinois' river bottomlands.\n12. American Elm (Ulmus americana)- Known as one of North America\u2019s most beautiful trees when in full leaf during summer but often considered iconic after being devastated by Dutch elm disease; found from northern New York down through Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana's hardwood forests to Illinois.\n\nDespite their different appearances or uses, these diverse tree species share the common characteristic of shedding leaves each autumn as part of a natural life cycle that has shaped the American landscape over thousands of years.",
