      "response": "Garrett Hobart, the 27th Vice President of the United States, served as Vice President from March 4, 1893, to September 14, 1895. During his tenure, Hobart played a significant role in shaping the country's foreign policy and was known for his strong leadership and diplomatic skills.\n\nHere are some key events and milestones during Hobart's vice presidency:\n\n1. **Spanish-American War (1898)**: Hobart served as Vice President during the Spanish-American War, which marked a significant turning point in American foreign policy. He was instrumental in securing the country's entry into the war on April 6, 1898, and played a key role in negotiating the Treaty of Paris, which ended the war on December 10, 1898.\n2. **Hay-Pauncefote Treaty (1894)**: Hobart negotiated the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty with Great Britain, which allowed for the construction of a transcontinental railroad and paved the way for American expansion into Central America.\n3. **Dollar Diplomacy (1890s)**: Hobart was a key figure in the \"Dollar Diplomacy\" policy, which aimed to promote American economic interests abroad by using military power to protect American investments and influence foreign governments. He played a crucial role in negotiating the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty and later served as Minister of Finance under President William McKinley.\n4. **Foreign Policy Crisis (1893)**: In 1893, Hobart faced a significant foreign policy crisis when President William McKinley was assassinated. Hobart succeeded McKinley as Vice President and took over the presidency, which he held until September 14, 1895.\n5. **Death of President McKinley (September 14, 1895)**: Hobart's tenure as Vice President ended abruptly when President McKinley was assassinated in Buffalo, New York. He died on September 14, 1895, and was succeeded by Vice President Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nOverall, Garrett Hobart played a significant role in shaping the country's foreign policy during his vice presidency, particularly through his work with the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty and his support for American expansionism. His diplomatic skills and strong leadership helped to secure important international agreements and paved the way for American growth and influence in the late 19th century.",
